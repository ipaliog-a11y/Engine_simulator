# PIXEL ENGINE SIM v0.4

**A lightweight, 8-bit style internal combustion engine *designer* & simulator** inspired by *Automation*.

Design an engine from the ground up — cylinders, bore & stroke, compression, forced
induction, exhaust, fuel octane, injection and ignition — then run it on the dyno and
watch the physics respond. Web-based, fully offline-capable, installable as a PWA.

## Features

### Engine Designer (new in v0.3)
Configure a build on the **DESIGN** tab, press **BUILD & DYNO**, and every parameter
feeds the physics:

- **Bottom end** — cylinder count (1–12), layout (inline / V / boxer), bore, stroke,
  compression ratio, redline. Bore × stroke × cylinders sets the displacement.
- **Air path** — naturally aspirated / turbo / supercharger, boost target, intercooler,
  turbo size (small / medium / large), and exhaust (stock / sport / race).
- **Valvetrain** — cam profile (stock / sport / race) and variable valve timing (VVT). A
  wilder cam moves the powerband up and adds top-end at the cost of low-end torque and idle
  quality; VVT recovers the bottom end for a broad powerband.
- **Fuel & spark** — fuel octane (RON), injector type (port / direct), ignition advance
  and ignition type (distributor / wasted spark / coil-on-plug).
- **Cooling** — radiator size (small / stock / large), cooling fan (none / mechanical /
  electric), oil cooler, and thermostat opening temperature.

These couple realistically: octane, compression, boost, intake temperature and ignition
advance all feed a **knock model**, and direct injection / higher octane buy back knock
margin so you can run more boost or timing. Get it wrong and the ECU derates power. The
**cooling subsystem** sets running temperatures in Auto Thermal mode — an under-sized
radiator with no fan will heat-soak and overheat under load (and at idle), which in turn
saps power; a large radiator, electric fan and oil cooler keep it cool.

### Simulation & live tuning
- **Live outputs**: Power (HP), Torque (Nm), BMEP, Volumetric Efficiency, Thermal
  Efficiency, BSFC, Fuel Flow, Knock Risk.
- **Animated cutaway** that renders your actual cylinder count through the full 4-stroke
  cycle (Intake → Compression → Power → Exhaust).
- **Dyno Curve** — full power & torque vs RPM out to your redline, with peak markers and a
  live current-RPM line.
- **Drive it (dynamic model)** — you control **THROTTLE** and **LOAD** (a dyno brake), not
  RPM directly. Opening the throttle raises manifold pressure (MAP), which makes torque,
  which spins the engine up through its **rotating inertia** (derived from displacement &
  stroke, so a big long-stroke engine revs lazily and a small one snaps up). A turbo
  spools as the revs climb; closed throttle gives engine braking; there's an idle floor
  and a rev limiter. No load + throttle = revs to the limiter; add load to hold an RPM.
- **Other runtime controls**: AFR, intake-air / coolant / oil temps.
- **Auto Thermal mode** — coolant & oil drift toward load-dependent targets over time,
  balanced against the cooling subsystem's capacity (radiator airflow scales with RPM;
  the fan provides idle cooling).
- **Engine sound** — Web Audio note pitched to firing frequency (scales with cylinder
  count & RPM) and load.
- **Save / Load** — stores and recalls the entire build + tune via `localStorage`.
- **Presets**: Optimal / Max Power / Eco / Reset (adapt to the current engine).
- **Installable PWA**, self-hosted font, works fully offline.

## How to Run

### Local
Serve the folder over HTTP and open `index.html`:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000    # then visit http://localhost:8000
```
> Opening via `file://` works too, but the PWA/offline features only activate over `http(s)`.

### GitHub Pages
This repo ships `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. Push to `main`, set **Settings → Pages →
Source: GitHub Actions**, and it deploys to
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Runtime Controls

| Control          | Range         | Notes |
|------------------|---------------|-------|
| Throttle         | 0 – 100 %     | Opens the flap → MAP → torque → revs |
| Load (dyno brake)| 0 – 100 %     | Resistance that sets steady RPM; 0 = free-rev to limiter |
| Air-Fuel Ratio   | 10.0 – 18.0   | ~12.5 peak power, ~15.5 peak efficiency |
| Intake Air Temp  | -10 – 60 °C   | Colder = denser charge = more power |
| Coolant Temp     | 40 – 130 °C   | Optimal ~90 °C (auto in Auto Thermal) |
| Oil Temp         | 40 – 150 °C   | Optimal ~100 °C (auto in Auto Thermal) |

RPM and MAP are now **outputs** (shown live under the sliders), not inputs. The **Dyno
Curve** tab remains a wide-open-throttle steady-state sweep for reading the full curve.

## Physics Notes (simplified educational model)

- Displacement derived from bore, stroke and cylinder count.
- Dynamic driveline: manifold pressure fills toward a throttle/RPM/boost target; net torque
  (combustion − pumping − friction − load) accelerates the crank through a rotating inertia
  derived from displacement and stroke. Pumping loss under vacuum gives engine braking; a
  rev limiter cuts fuel at redline; an idle floor prevents stalling.
- VE uses a broad generalized-bell breathing curve (flat plateau, gentle shoulders) so
  torque stays flat across the midrange and power keeps climbing toward redline instead of
  falling off a peaky Gaussian. Its peak shifts with bore/stroke ratio and redline; exhaust
  choice trades low-end for top-end scavenging.
- Camshaft profile shifts the VE peak and adds top-end breathing/scavenging at the cost of
  low-end VE and idle quality (a wild cam idles high and lumpy). VVT restores most of the
  low end, widening the powerband — strong bottom *and* top.
- Output is calibrated to sane ballpark figures (e.g. a 2.0 L turbo at 0.8 bar / sport
  exhaust / 98 RON makes ~255 hp & ~350 Nm; a 2.0 NA ~130 hp), with only a gentle power
  drop from peak to redline.
- Compression scales indicated work and efficiency via a relative Otto-cycle factor.
- Forced induction raises achievable MAP; without an intercooler the charge heats up.
  Superchargers cost parasitic drive power.
- Turbo boost spools with RPM along a logistic curve: small turbos spool early (strong
  midrange) but choke the top end, large turbos lag down low but flow more up top. Actual
  boost also lags in time (turbo lag), so it builds over ~1 s in the live Engine View.
- Ignition timing has a max-brake-torque optimum — too little or too much loses power, and
  over-advance feeds knock.
- Knock combines boost, compression, charge/coolant temperature, RPM, timing and mixture,
  offset by octane and direct injection; high knock derates power.
- Cooling balances load-generated heat against radiator capacity + airflow (RPM-driven)
  and fan; the thermostat sets the floor temperature. Overheating (>~108 °C) costs power.
- Standard 4-stroke BMEP → Torque → Power conversion throughout.

Numbers are calibrated to a realistic ballpark but this is not a high-fidelity thermodynamic
model — it's tuned for fun, learning and rapid experimentation (the "light Automation"
philosophy).

> **Android note:** the app is intentionally a self-contained, offline-capable PWA with no
> server or external network dependencies and all persistence in `localStorage`. That keeps
> it wrappable into an Android APK later (Capacitor or a Trusted Web Activity) with minimal
> changes. New features are kept touch-friendly and framework-free to preserve that path.
